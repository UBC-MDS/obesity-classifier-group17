   - Use clear and consistent markdown formatting in notebook cells.
3. **Testing**: Ensure all existing tests pass and, if necessary, write new tests for added functionality. If applicable, include test cells in the relevant Jupyter notebook.
4. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
